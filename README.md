# Edge and Boundary Detection Project
This project focuses on edge and boundary detection in images using the Hough transform and active contour models (snakes). It is part of an assignment due on March 26th, 2024.



## Description
The tasks performed include:
- **Task 1**: Detection of edges using the Canny edge detector, and detection of lines, circles, and ellipses (if any) followed by superimposing the detected shapes on the given images.
- **Task 2**: Initialization of contours for given objects and evolution of the Active Contour Model (snake) using the greedy algorithm. The output is represented as chain code, and both the perimeter and the area inside these contours are computed.
